    <p>
    Hi! My name is Alfred. I am a 3rd year <b><a href="https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Engineering Physics</a></b> student at 
    the University of British Columbia, with a minor in Math.
    <br><br>
    I love working with mechanical systems, robots, and machine learning. I hope to use the multidisplinary skills and experiences 
    I've accrued to develop technology that betters our world.
    <br><br>
    I created this website to showcase some my projects as well as to explore front-end web design.
