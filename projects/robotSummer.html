        <h2>Overview + Background</h2>
        <p>ENPH 253 is the UBC Engineering Physics program's annual 6-week long robot competition (aka Robot Summer). Students work in teams of 4 to build an autonomous 
            robot that can score points based on rules that change according to the competition theme for that year. With rare exception, students design everything about 
            the robots: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mechanical parts need to be fabricated either by hand, laser/waterjet cut, 3D printed, or machined</li>
            <li>Electrical circuits must be soldered/wired by hand</li>
            <li>And software to control the robot is written by us</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I did the competition in 2024 and the theme was inspired by the game Overcooked - a chaotic co-op game about coordinating with your teammates to cook food.
            The cooperative nature of the game led to the 2024 competition having one very important note: For the first time in Robot Summer history, <b>teams would make 2 robots</b>
            that coordinate with each other to assemble food.
        </p>

      <section id="Competition Rules">
        <h2>Competition Rules</h2>
        <p>Here is a diagram of the competition surface:</p>
        <figure class="description-image">

            <figcaption>Competition layout</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As you can see, there are 2 tracks, one for each robot. Remote control of any kind is not allowed and robots need to be small enough to pass through their own "kitchens."
            Additionally, robots cannot extend past the far edges of their kitchen's counter to the other kitchen. Points are achieved by teams delivering various food items 
            comprised of raw ingredients on plates to the serving area; points are deducted if food isn't well-assembled (no customer would want a burger thats falling apart).
            There are some more intricacies on cooking/cutting and a lot of pedantics but for now, this summary of the rules should give a good picture of what the competition looked like.

      <section id="Initial Ideas/Designs">
        <h2>Initial Ideas/Designs</h2>
        <p>One of the main issues we grappled with in the early stages was the inherent assymetry of the two robots. Each bot has access to different stations and some tasks
            are exclusive to one robot. For example, the robot on the second track (the one with the serving station), robot B, is the only robot that can deliver food while 
            the robot on the first track, robot A, has access to way more ingredient stations. We decided that the majority of the cooking/assembly work would fall to A while
            B would do relatively less assembly and focus on delivery. As such, and inspired by Breaking Bad, we named B Jesse Pinkman, or JP, and A as Heisenburger, or HB.
            Lastly, we decided to go for deluxe burgers (bun, patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese) as they were worth the most points. To summarise:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HB would take a plate and assemble burgers as much as it could then pass it to JP</li>
            <li>JP would finish assembling the burger, with a top bun passed from HB's kitchen</li>
            <li>JP serves the burger</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With duties split, we now had to figure out to make each bot do what we want it to. After some spitballing, we landed on some comprehensive <b>initial</b> designs 
            for each robot. (these would not last as we encountered more design challenges). HB would be comprised of a conveyor belt system and two plate holders. The belts 
            would manipulate any food items we need as well as whatever burger we were currently assembling. To get the plate holders up to belt level, we would use servos 
            attached to a pulley system to move the plate holders up and down on a guided track to avoid collision with the belt.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Initial design of HB</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We would soon scrap the pulleys and opt for a different method to move the holder up and down since the pulleys would be too unreliable and could be sensitive to 
            vibrations. I'll cover what would replace it in the next section. but that'll be covered in the next section. JP would have a similar conveyor belt system but 
            would have just that plus two claws on both ends for food intake/output. 
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>One component that we ended up cutting was the fry dispenser. We had initially wanted to serve fries alongside the burger since they were worth quite a bit
            of points but time constraint led us to scrapping the design. Nonetheless, I thought I'd talk about it still since it was a part of the initial design.
            Fries in competition are 4 strips velcroed together, the fry dispenser aligned all 4 strips and used a cutter connected to a servo to split the fry before a
            rack and pinion would push the individual fry onto the belt.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Design of the scrapped fry dispenser</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Lastly, for driving we'd use omni-wheels to simplify steering since it vastly simplified driving and allowed us to focus more on object manipulation, which
            was a very common design choice among teams. Before moving on, I want to comment that these designs were very much overnegineerred. There are a lot of moving parts
            and unneeded complexity. In a way, that was intentional. We had decided at the start that if we were going to win, we had to do it in style; we wanted to learn a
            lot and have fun so we were fine with a relatively complex design. In hindsight, this was a fine mindset to have, but, at least for me, I failed to temper it with
            a pragmatic approach and the consequences of such complex designs would soon rear their head.
        </p>

      <section id="The Lift System">
        <h2>The Lift System</h2>
        <p>While all teammates dabbled in every aspect of the project, I was primarily in charge of the mechanical design along with my teammate Anton Shoham. Our final 
            designs ended up having some key subsystems:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chassis and drivetrain for both bots</li>
            <li>Conveyor Belt system for both bots</li>
            <li>Claws for both bots</li>
            <li>Lift system for HB</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Anton and I both worked on the claws, chassis, and drivetrains. The belt systems were primarily Anton while I worked extensively on the lift system for HB. 
            I mentioned previously that we would quickly scrap the pulleys to move the plate holders up and down. This lift system is what ended up replacing it. The lift had
            a couple of requirements:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The platform had to be able to reliably and stably move in two axes</li>
            <li>The system had to be as small as possible</li>
            <li>Movement needs to be controllable</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            As this project was my first real exposure to comprehensive mechanical design, there was a lot of experimentation and figuring out what worked since, at
            the time, I lacked the intuition and experience I possess now when it comes to designing mechanical systems. I had to learn the fundamentals such as what
            fixtures I would need and how to translate motion. To mimic the pulley's guided movement, I wanted the lift to be able to move in both a vertical axis
            and a horizontal axis. My first step was figuring out how to achieve vertical movement. I decided a DC motor with a lead screw would be best for this task 
            as the range of motion was big enough that servos were off the table and lead screws provided a reliable way to translate the motion.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Me figuring out how lead screws worked for the first time</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now the concept was promising but there were some clear flaws with my initial exploration of lead screws:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How would I mount the lift to the lead screw</li>
            <li>How do I minimise wobbling while the motor is running and keep the entire system stable</li>
            <li>How would I add the horizontal motion on top of all this</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After some time thinking about these challenges, I landed on this design:</p>
        <figure class="description-image">
            <img src="../assets/robotSummer/liftCAD.png" alt="liftCAD">
            <figcaption>Design of the lift system</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="description-image">
            <img src="../assets/robotSummer/closeUps.png" alt="liftCAD closeups">
            <figcaption>The gear-servo system for horizontal motion and a close up on the mounting nut</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            I used a variety of materials based on different factors. The platform had a mix of hardboard, balsa wood, and acrylic while the various other parts were either
            plastic, aluminum or steel. The lead screw itself was made of steel due to the manufacturer while the other supporting rod was aluminum to save on weight. plastic
            was used for the mounts since their relatively complex geometry lended well to 3D printing. Acrylic was used for the bottom of the platform so I could see into the
            gear system and hardboard/balsa were used because of their availability and ease of use. To mount the lift on the lead screw, I designed 
            a mounting nut and horizontal motion would be achieved through a servo-gear system that moved with the lift. For stability, I added a guide rail as well as two 
            pieces of hardboard to keep the platform parallel to the ground.
        </p>
        <figure class="description-image">
            <img src="../assets/robotSummer/liftAnnotated.png" alt="liftCAD explained">
            <figcaption>Close ups of the lift stabilisers and me machining the mounting nut</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            All the pieces of harboard were press-fit together which I would usually be concerned with due to the difficulty of getting the correct hole sizes
            but the high accuracy of the laser cutter meant that wasn't a problem. The design worked like a charm; the platform could stably move in two axes while 
            not being large. All that was left was to control the movement. The servo was easy but the DC motor was a challenge but I could use the fact that food 
            assembly and plate stacking was a well-defined process. After consulting with Soroush and Jacob, my teammates primarily responsible for the electrical systems
            and software, I placed a microswitch on the bottom of the platform, on the side which contained the mounting nut. We decided that at the start of a run, we
            would run the motor till the platform hit the top of the motor mount and use that as a reference position. From there we could measure the position of the platform
            after running the motor at a certain voltage after a certain amount of time and use that to hardcode software. It wasn't the best solution but we were running tight
            on time for the competition and I trusted Soroush and Jacob.
        </p>
        <p>
            With some last minute adjustments to accomodate the drivetrain (the DC motor was moved above the platform on a hardboard piece), the lift system was complete and
            ready to go on HB.

      <section id="Conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Going into the competition, I was raring to go for that win and make a design I would be proud of. Well, I made
            a design I was happy with, but the win didn't come. And in the end, our team unfortunately just didn't have working bots
            on the day of competition. There were so many factors that could have led to this outcome and I didn't want to think or dwell
            on those reasons because frankly, that result stung.
        </p>
        <p>
            I look back on this project and its outcome a lot. Maybe I could have simplified the design so we wouldnt've been so constrained with time.
            Or maybe I could've helped with the other parts of the robots. Or maybe better communication could've helped. 
            I was frustrated with the result because to me, it was an undeniable failure. But after a lot of reflection,
            I've actually come to appreciate this project and outcome much more. It was my first big foreay into mechanical design and I learned
            so much from it. I learned how to design mechanical systems, how to design parts for manufacturing, how to work
            in a team, how to manage time and resources, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Robot summer is a defining experience of the UBC Engineering Physics program. Some teams place high and some teams
            get a result like we did. But from all those hours I spent in the lab working late, I know that everyone who went through
            robot summer worked insanely hard and learned a lot. I'm going into my capstone project now and I wouldn't feel half
            as confident taking it on if I hadn't done robot summer first. I'm immensely grateful for the growth I experienced,
            both personal and technical, from this project. If nothing else, I worked hard and came out of this project a better engineer
            and a more resilient person, and I'm quite happy with that.
