        <h2>Overview+Background</h2>
        <p>
          ENPH 353 was a project course aimed at introducing students to machine learning techniques and
          getting us familiar with the concepts of data collection/analysis, model training, and working in a
          linux environment. The project of this course was a competition to create the best robot detective 
          that could independently drive around a predefined course and read clues from boards placed around the map.

          To give slightly more detail, the robot detective was a simulated self-driving car that had to navigate a course
          while avoiding obstacles and reading clueboards using computer vision. The clueboards contained alphanumeric characters
          that the robot had to read and report back to a central server. The robot was scored based on how many clueboards it
          could successfully read within a time limit as well as some other factors such as good driving and collisions.

          Before discussing this project further, I want to preface this by saying this page is not intended to be comprehensive at all.
          At the end of the course, our instructors required us to create a report with a much more complete overview of
          the technical details of the project. This report can be found <a href="../assets/enph353/enph353_report.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>. 
          What I will be discussing on this page is more a brief overview of the concepts and skills I applied as well as a condensed summary of how our robot worked.
          I want to provide a page that is readable without ML knowledge and that still gives a clear insight into my experience with this project.
          Lastly, I would like to thank my teammate, Rachel, for her contributions to this project. We wouldn't have scored as much as we did 
          without her work.

      <section id="Agent Structure">
        <h2>Agent Structure</h2>
        <p>
          This section will be brief since this content is detailed in the report; the robot detective was structured as an agent 
          that contained two modules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Driving Module:</strong> The module that controlled navigation around the course </li>
            <li><strong>Clue Reading Module:</strong> The module that controlled clue interpretation and submission </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As mentioned in the report, each module was developed and tested independently before being integrated into the final agent.
          I was responsible for the clue reading module so that, and any concepts related to it, are what I'll be discussing on this page.
        </p>

      <section id="Clue Reading: Image Processing">
        <h2>Clue Reading: Image Processing</h2>
        <p>
          The main problem involved in clue reading was how do we take an image of a clueboard and extract the alphanumeric characters from it?
          Well, this course was all about machine learning so I wanted to apply some ML techniques to solve this problem.
          In particular, one concept felt perfect for this problem: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I'll discuss CNNs more 
          in a later section and why they're ideal for this problem, but for now, we can view CNNs as functions that take an
          image as an input and spit out a character.
